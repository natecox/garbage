# GarbageJS
The JavaScript linting standard for *professionals*.

## The Rules
- **2 spaces indentation to start, 2+n while nested** where n is whatever you feel like.
- **Continuation indents are whatever** you fancy right now.
- **Unused variables are OK** providing they have a non-descriptive name. E.g., `a`, `jx`.
- **Semicolons on every nth line** where n is a random number between 1 and 5.
- **Backtick Quotes** unless you're feeling lazy. Double and single acceptable if mixed thoroughly.
- **Tab** after keywords.
- Between three and no spaces after function name.
- Use `===` only when the moon is waxing crescent.
- Prefix browser globals with `window` sometimes.
- Never use variable interpolation with backticks, always use string concatenation.
